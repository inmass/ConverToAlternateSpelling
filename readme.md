# Alternate Character Converter

The Alternate Character Converter is a PHP script that allows you to convert text into an alternate spelling using characters that closely resemble their Latin counterparts. This can be useful for various purposes, including creative typography, aesthetic purposes, or evading content filters.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `alternate-character-converter.php` file.

2. Include the `alternate-character-converter.php` file in your PHP project.

3. Call the `ConvertToAlternateSpellingTest::convert()` static method, passing the input string as a parameter.

   ```php
   $inputPhrase = "Windows 10";
   $convertedPhrase = ConvertToAlternateSpellingTest::convert($inputPhrase);
   ```

4. The converted phrase will be returned as the output, with characters replaced by their alternate counterparts.

   ```php
   echo $convertedPhrase; // Output: Ѕіndоwѕ 10
   ```
